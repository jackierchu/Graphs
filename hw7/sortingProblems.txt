1. Quicksort, BSTs, Mergesort

a. List all comparisons performed by Quicksort when sorting [5, 3, 2, 1, 7, 8, 4, 6] using the stable partitioning procedure described in class. The answers for the first partitioning operation are provided for you. The order for which pair does not matter (either 5-3 or 3-5 is fine). You may find running the provided Quicksort class to be useful. 

5-3, 5-2, 5-1, 5-7, 5-8, 5-4, 5-6,3-2,3-1,3-4, 2-1, 7-6, 7-8

b. List all comparisons performed when inserting [5, 3, 2, 1, 7, 8, 4, 6] into a BST. Give your comparisons in the order they occur. The first few have been provided for you:

5-3, 5-2, 3-2, 5-1, 3-1, 2-1, 5-7, 5-8, 7-8, 5-4, 3-4, 5-6, 6-7


c. What do you observe about the set of comparisons performed by Quicksort vs. BST insertion?
The total comparisons performed by QuickSort and BST insertion is the same. In QuickSort,
the index is set iteratively. In BST Insertion, we are partitioning based on the root of the
tree. Therefore, the comparisons are similar in form and are isomorphic.


d. True or false: Suppose we have an array x which, when inserted into a BST from x[0..], results in a bushy BST. For any such array x, quicksorting x using the leftmost item as a pivot and the partitioning algorithm from part a will always be fast (i.e. N log N time instead of N^2).
True. It is true because if we have an insertion of n elements, it will create a BST of nlogn.
Therefore, partitioning and the insertion has a similar form which leads to having the same time complexity.

e. Give an example of a comparison performed by Mergesort that is not given in your answers to 1a or 1b.
[5, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9] becomes
[4, 5] [2, 3], [6, 7], [8, 9] becomes
[2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]. Then it becomes
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
